C. Using ROW_NUMBER() with PARTITION
The following example uses the PARTITION BY argument to partition the query result set by the column TerritoryName. 
The ORDER BY clause specified in the OVER clause orders the rows in each partition by the column SalesYTD. 
The ORDER BY clause in the SELECT statement orders the entire query result set by TerritoryName.

RANK FUNCTION

A. Ranking rows within a partition
The following example ranks the products in inventory the specified inventory locations according to their quantities.
 The result set is partitioned by LocationID and logically ordered by Quantity. 
 Notice that products 494 and 495 have the same quantity. Because they are tied, they are both ranked one.
 
 ROW_NUMBER and RANK are similar. ROW_NUMBER numbers all rows sequentially (for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). 
 RANK provides the same numeric value for ties (for example 1, 2, 2, 4, 5).
