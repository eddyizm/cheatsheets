# OOP concepts  
---
1. Encapsulation is when a group of related methods, properties, and other members are treated as a single object.

2. Inheritance is the ability to receive (“inherit”) methods and properties from an existing class.

3. Polymorphism is when each class implements the same methods in varying ways, but you can still have several classes that can be utilized interchangeably.

4. Abstraction is the process by which a developer hides everything other than the relevant data about an object in order to simplify and increase efficiency


### What is an interface class?
Interface is an abstract class which has only public abstract methods and the methods only have the 
declaration and not the definition. These abstract methods must be implemented in the inherited classes. 

 
### What are main features of OOP?
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Inheritance

### What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation is referred to one of the following two notions.
1. Data hiding: A language feature to restrict access to members of an object. For example, private and protected members in C++.
2. Bundling of data and methods together: Data and methods that operate on that data are bundled together.

#### Abstraction
Abstraction is "To represent the essential feature without representing the background details."

Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.

Abstraction provides you a generalized view of your classes or objects by providing relevant information.

Abstraction is the process of hiding the working style of an object, and showing the information of an object in an understandable manner.

### Encapsulation
Wrapping up a data member and a method together into a single unit (in other words class) is called Encapsulation.

Encapsulation is like enclosing in a capsule. That is enclosing the related operations and data related to an object into that object.

### overloading / overriding
Overloading is when you have multiple methods in the same scope, with the same name but different signatures. Overriding is a principle that allows you to change the functionality of a method in a child class.
